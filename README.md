### Tools I use

I look for tools with good defaults that allow for efficient, distraction free working.
- Window manager: i3 (or sway if you want wayland)
- Text editor: Helix
- Shell: Fish (seriously underrated, nearly no config needed)
- Terminal/Multiplexer: Ghostty + Zellij
- Writing/Reports: typst
  
### Technology and Languages I like

C++ - Has everything you need

C - Classic, no bs programming

Haskell - The type system and GHCi are nice

Typescript - Makes web programming feel kind of OK

Python - A language that doesn't get in your way
