# Hi and welcome

## whoami

I like everything computers. Besides that, I also enjoy painting and drawing.

- Currently I am working on my C++, Computer Graphics and GPU Programming knowledge
- I have a (not so active) blog at [https://blog.mirekk.dev](https://blog.mirekk.dev)
    - The source code for the blog is my [own](https://github.com/MirruK/blog-example). You can host your own version of it if you wish!

## Some things I made

### [blog-example](https://github.com/MirruK/blog-example): This is the source code for the blog template I use for my personal website.
- It can pull your github pinned repos and display them
- It integrates with the Contentful CMS for article writing and publishing flows
- Blog articles are styled according to the markdown they are written in
  - Support for highlighted code blocks is included
- The repo has a github actions runner that builds and uploads publicly available container images for the blog
  - A container with the website can be ran without any other setup than the environment variables
  - An image is built and for both amd64 and arm64

### [cnake](https://github.com/MirruK/cnake): A basic snake game implemented for fun and learning.
- Built using only C++ and SDL3.
- The game has rudimentary state handling, texture caching, fps counting, and other small features that you expect by default
in an actual game engine.
- I puposefully implemented this game while knowing nothing at all about how games and game engines are usually made
  - Many things could have been done differently, some of these are documented in the project readme 
- The reason for creating this game was to start learning the c++ standard library and cmake

Check it out! It should be easy to run on most systems by using the cmake files provided.

## Tools I use

I look for tools with good defaults that allow for efficient, distraction free working.
- Window manager: i3 (or sway if you want wayland)
- Text editor: Helix
- Shell: Fish (seriously underrated, nearly no config needed)
- Terminal/Multiplexer: Ghostty (no need for tmux/zellij, those features are built into ghostty)
- Writing/Reports: typst
  
## Technology and Languages I like

C++ - Has everything you need

C - Classic, no bs programming

Haskell - The type system and GHCi are nice

Typescript - Makes web programming feel kind of OK

Python - A language that doesn't get in your way
